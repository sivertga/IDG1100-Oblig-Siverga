      <h2>Section I – OS, Kernel, Shell</h2>
      <h3>1. What components are part of the Von Neuman Architecture</h3>
      <p>A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers, A control unit that contains an instruction, register and program counter, Memory that stores data and instructions, External mass storage, Input and output mechanisms</p>
      <h3>2. What is user space?</h3>
      <p>
        User space is the location where the normal user processes run. These
        processes run with limited privileges, while the kernel space has access
        to the user sections, and runs in supervisor mode.
      </p>
      <h3>3. What is the shell?</h3>
      <p>
        A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers
        input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program
        finishes executing, it displays that program's output. There are many shell variants, for example Bourne shell, C shell, emacs shell. 
      </p>
      <h3>4. Where is the shell located?</h3>
      <p>Inside the hardware-> kernel space.</p>
      <h3>5. What is the main task of the shell?</h3>
      <p>Perform and read tasks from your computer.</p>

      <h2>Section II – UNIX, Scripting</h2>
      <h3>
        6. What is the octal representation of a file that can be read and
        written only by its owner?
      </h3>
      <p> The octal digit is 6. User got 4+2, group got 0, other got 0. So Chmod 600</p>
      <h3>
        7. In UNIX systems, what is the common name of the special user that can
        access and modify every file?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Superuser can access all files and edit them. When you’re a superuser,
        you operate in the root folder.
      </p>
      <h3>8. Which file permission classes are available in UNIX systems?</h3>
      <p>User, group, other, all.</p>
      <h3>9. As of 2020, which percentage of servers have UNIX-like OS?</h3>
      <p>About 70% uses an UNIX-like OS.</p>
      <h3>10. The command ssh will:</h3>
      <p>
        Login to a remote computer and perform operations. Can also be used to
        transfer data.
      </p>
      <h3>11. UNIX Command: access your current working directory:</h3>
      <p>You can use cd to navigate between directories, and you can view the directory you’re in by typing pwd.</p>
      <h3>12. UNIX Command: rename files (give an example) :</h3>
      <p>
        you can use mv to move the directory to another one, then you will be
        available to rename the file. Example: mv “startfile” “filenew”. This
        will get rid of the startfile and copy the content into the filenew
        directory.
      </p>
      <h3>
        13. UNIX Command: schedule the execution of programs in the future:
      </h3>
      <p>Crontab -e</p>
      <h3>
        14. UNIX Command: Forcefully shutdown the command with process ID 123
      </h3>
      <p>Kill 123</p>
      <h3>15. UNIX Command: access your root user :</h3>
      <p>sudo -s</p>
      <h3>17. Crontab scheduled: At minute 30 on day-of-month 15.</h3>
      <p>Crontab -e 30 * 15 * *.</p>
      <h3>
        18. Crontab scheduled: At 05:30 on every day-of-week from Sunday through
        Monday in June.

        read $username
        echo -Now=$(date +"%m-%d-%Y")
        echo "$Now" "$username" </code>
      <h3>20. Script: add two numeric values, print the result:</h3>
      <code>echo -n "Enther the first number"
         read num1
         echo -n "Enter the second number" 
         read num2
         sum=`expr $num1 + $num2`
         echo "The sum of the two values is $sum</code>
      <h3>21. Script: inputs username, prints “USERNAME stored”:</h3>
      <code>
        echo "Enter username"
        read $username
        echo "$username stored"</code>
        <p>or</p>

        Display “This script is running on _.” where “_” is the output of the
        “hostname” command.
      </h3>
