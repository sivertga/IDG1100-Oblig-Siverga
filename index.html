      <h3>1. What components are part of the Von Neuman Architecture</h3>
      <p>CPU, memory, and input/output.</p>
      <h3>2. What is user space?</h3>
      <p>
        User space is the location where the normal user processes run. These

        A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers
        input from you and executes programs based on that input. When a program
        finishes executing, it displays that program's output.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Where is the shell located?</h3>
      <p>In your local pc user, in the terminal.</p>
      <h3>5. What is the main task of the shell?</h3>
      <p>Perform and read tasks from your computer.</p>

    <p>Login to a remote computer and perform operations. Can also be used to transfer data.</p>
    <h3>11. UNIX Command: access your current working directory: </h3>

    <h3>12. UNIX Command: rename files (give an example) :</h3>
    <p>you can use mv to move the directory to another one, then you will be available to rename the file.  Example: mv “startfile” “filenew”. This will get rid of the startfile and copy the content into the filenew directory. </p>
